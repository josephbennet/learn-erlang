# **Learn You Some Erlang**

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey with the book "Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!" by Fred HÃ©bert. Here, you will find my notes on the foundational concepts of Erlang programming as well as the code I've written while working through the exercises in the book.

## **About the Book**

"Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!" is a comprehensive guide to learning the Erlang programming language, which is widely used in distributed, fault-tolerant systems. The book covers a wide range of topics, from basic syntax and data types to concurrency, error handling, and OTP, Erlang's framework for building fault-tolerant applications.

## **What You'll Find in this Repository**

In this repository, you'll find my notes on the key concepts covered in the book, as well as the code I've written while working through the exercises. The code is organized by chapter, and each chapter has its own directory. Within each directory, you'll find the code for that chapter's exercises, as well as any additional examples or experiments I've done related to that chapter's material.

## **How to Use This Repository**

If you're also studying "Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!", you may find my notes and code helpful as a supplement to the book. You can browse the code for each chapter to see how I approached the exercises and experiments, or you can use the code as a starting point for your own exploration of the concepts covered in the book.

## **Getting Started with Erlang**

If you're new to Erlang, I recommend starting with the official Erlang website at **[erlang.org](https://www.erlang.org/)**. From there, you can download the Erlang runtime system, which includes the Erlang virtual machine and a number of useful tools and libraries. You can also find documentation, tutorials, and other learning resources on the site.

## **Contributing**

If you find any errors or have suggestions for improving my code or notes, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I welcome any feedback or contributions that can help me improve my understanding of Erlang programming!
